# PHPeclipse Inspired Syntax Theme

This is an ode to the true love of my life : PHPeclipse (I miss you buddy). The syntax coloring is easy on the eye.
Primary coloring ranges from blue to purple so there are no sharp contrasts in colors. This leaves your brain to be able to
concentrate on the code. Subtle coloring is there to help you know when you've typed the correct keyword.
Constants and numbers are of a more reddish hue so they stand out more for your eye to catch them.
White background so that your mind is clear to think.

Falls back on Atom Light for non-php syntax theming
